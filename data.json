He has committed .5 hectares to the forest preserve that surrounds the area and only cultivates coffee on 1 hectare of land. He grows 100% Caturra variety of Arabica coffee on his farm. The coffee is washed and then dry fermented for 20 hours. It is then dried on Parabolic raised beds. Parabolic beds are raised beds that are usually under a shelter or in an area similar to a green house. This is important for proper drying because of the varying micro-climates in Colombia that have high moisture levels year round, making it difficult for coffee to reach the desired internal moisture level in a proper amount of time.",
